				<h4>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep1</h4>
				<h3>A Personal Voyage </h3>
				<h1>"The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p> Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the 
				cosmos and a "Spaceship of the Imagination" (shaped like 
				a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universe's 
				hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda 
				Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, 
				and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' successful 
				calculation of the circumference of Earth leads to a 
				description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. 
				Finally, the "Ages of Science" are described, before 
				pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 
				Note: the revised version of the series adds an introduction 
				by Ann Druyan to this episode, recorded after Sagan's death, 
				in which she discusses some of the changes that occurred 
				in the years after its broadcast.

				<h1>"One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial 
				selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an 
				opening into a larger discussion of evolution through 
				natural selection (and the pitfalls of intelligent design). 
				Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic 
				Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in 
				growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common 
				biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the 
				molecules of life in the Miller–Urey experiment; and 
				speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). 
				In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also 
				controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the 
				different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic 
				molecules or causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event).

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep3</h2>
				<h1>"Harmony of the Worlds"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Beginning with the separation of the fuzzy thinking and pious 
				fraud of astrology from the careful observations of astronomy, 
				Sagan follows the development of astronomical observation. 
				Beginning with constellations and ceremonial calendars (such as 
				those of the Anasazi), the story moves to the debate between Earth 
				and Sun-centered models: Ptolemy and the geocentric worldview, 
				Copernicus' theory, the data-gathering of Tycho Brahe, and the 
				achievements of Johannes Kepler (Kepler's laws of planetary motion
				and the first science-fiction novel).

				<p>Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, 
				giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact 
				described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description 
				of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories 
				of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by
				the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse 
				effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global 
				warming.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep5</h2>
				<h1>"Blues for a Red Planet"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with 
				scientific and fictional speculation about the Red 
				Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
				centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar 
				Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival 
				Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves 
				to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, 
				inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by 
				Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life 
				on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the 
				terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos 
				Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's 
				and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.</p>

				<h1>"Travellers' Tales"</h1>

			</header>
				<p>The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of 
				the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-
				long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary 
				thinkers (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). 
				Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' 
				discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos 
				Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and 
				Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is 
				shown.</p>

			</header>
				<p>Carl Sagan teaches students in a classroom in his childhood 
				home in Brooklyn, New York, which leads into a history of the 
				different mythologies about stars and the gradual revelation 
				of their true nature. In ancient Greece, some philosophers 
				(Aristarchus of Samos, Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, Theodorus 
				of Samos, Empedocles, Democritus) freely pursue scientific 
				knowledge, while others (Plato, Aristotle, and the Pythagoreans)
				advocate slavery and epistemic secrecy.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep8</h2>
				<h1>"Journeys in Space and Time"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Ideas about time and space are explored in the changes 
				that constellations undergo over time, the redshift and blue 
				shift measured in interstellar objects, time dilation in 
				Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, the designs of both 
				Leonardo da Vinci and spacecraft that could travel near light 
				speed, time travel and its hypothetical effects on human 
				history, the origins of the Solar System, the history of 
				life, and the immensity of space. In Cosmos Update, the idea 
				of faster-than-light travel by wormholes (researched by Kip 
				Thorne and shown in Sagan's novel Contact) is discussed.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep9</h2>
				<h1>"The Lives of the Stars"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>The simple act of making an apple pie is extrapolated into
				the atoms and subatomic particles (electrons, protons, and 
				neutrons) necessary. Many of the ingredients necessary are
				formed of chemical elements formed in the life and deaths of 
				stars (such as our own Sun), resulting in massive red giants 
				and supernovae or collapsing into white dwarfs, neutron stars, 
				pulsars, and even black holes. These produce all sorts of 
				phenomena, such as radioactivity, cosmic rays, and even the 
				curving of spacetime by gravity. Cosmos Update mentions the 
				supernova SN 1987A and neutrino astronomy.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep10</h2>
				<h1>"The Edge of Forever"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Beginning with the origins of the universe in the Big Bang, 
				Sagan describes the formation of different types of galaxies 
				and anomalies such as galactic collisions and quasars. The 
				episode moves further into ideas about the structure of the 
				Universe, such as different dimensions (in the imaginary 
				Flatland and four-dimensional hypercubes), an infinite vs. 
				a finite universe, and the idea of an oscillating Universe 
				(similar to that in Hindu cosmology). The search into other 
				ideas such as dark matter and the multiverse is shown, using 
				tools such as the Very Large Array in New Mexico. Cosmos 
				Update shows new information about the odd, irregular surfaces 
				of galaxies and the Milky Way perhaps being a barred spiral 
				galaxy.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep11</h2>
				<h1>"The Persistence of Memory"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>The idea of intelligence is explored in the concepts of 
				computers (using bits as their basic units of information), 
				whales (in their songs and their disruptions by human 
				activities), DNA, the human brain (the evolution of the brain 
				stem, frontal lobes, neurons, cerebral hemispheres, and 
				corpus callosum under the Triune Brain Model), and man-
				made structures for collective intelligence (cities, 
				libraries, books, computers, and satellites). The episode 
				ends with speculation on alien intelligence and the 
				information conveyed on the Voyager Golden Record.</p>

				<h2>Carl Sagan Cosmos S1 Ep12</h2>
				<h1>"Encyclopaedia Galactica"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Questions are raised about the search for intelligent 
				life beyond the Earth, with UFOs and other close encounters 
				refuted in favor of communications through SETI and radio 
				telescope such as the Arecibo Observatory. The probability 
				of technically advanced civilizations existing elsewhere 
				in the Milky Way is interpreted using the Drake equation 
				and a future hypothetical Encyclopedia Galactica (similar 
				to Rosetta Stone) is discussed as a repository of 
				information about other worlds in the galaxy. The Cosmos 
				Update notes that there have been fewer sightings of 
				UFOs and more stories of abductions, while mentioning 
				the META scanning the skies for signals.</p>

				<h1>"Who Speaks for Earth"</h1>
				</hgroup>
			</header>
				<p>Sagan reflects on the future of humanity and the question 
				of "who speaks for Earth?" when meeting extraterrestrials. He
				discusses the very different meetings of the Tlingit people 
				and explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse with the destruction 
				of the Aztecs by Spanish conquistadors, the looming threat 
				of nuclear warfare, and the threats shown by destruction of 
				the Library of Alexandria and the murder of Hypatia. The 
				episode ends with an overview of the beginning of the universe, 
				the evolution of life, and the accomplishments of humanity 
				and makes a plea to mankind to cherish life and continue its 
				journey in the cosmos. The Cosmos Update notes the 
				preliminary reconnaissance of planets with spacecraft, the 
				fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of apartheid in South 
				Africa, and measures towards the reduction of nuclear weapons.</p>
